# Liu Edits
Hi! I'm Albert Liu. Here's a summary of the edits I'm planning to make/have made.

## Checklist
* [x] Reworking Functions
* [x] numpy
* [x] cython
* [ ] pandas
* [ ] Bugs and Testing Framework
* [ ] README TODO's

## Overview
In general the edits that I made were for method specificity, runtime, and bug fixing.

## Reworking functions
I'm going to try to make common_align faster and easier to read. I'm also going to do a similar thing to the other align functions. One of the ways I'm going to do this is by changing all the alignment functions to work with integer arrays instead of strings. This way the implementation will be a little disconnected from the information -- might make it easier to do things like align mRNA. I'm also going to create a few encoder-decoders and a set of functions to encode sequences into integers.

## NumPy
I used numpy to make operations faster.
* [x] Alignment Functions
	* [x] global
	* [x] semi-global
	* [x] local
	* [x] common

# Pandas
I used pandas to make reading in data simpler and faster.
* [ ] importing
* [ ] exporting

## Cython
I used cython to reduce the python/numpy overhead with accessing arrays.
* [x] Variables
	* [x] global_align
	* [x] semi-global_align
	* [x] local_align
	* [x] common_align
* [x] Arrays
	* [x] global_align
	* [x] semi-global_align
	* [x] local_align
	* [x] common_align

## README TODO's
- [ ] have to figure out how to allow gaps at the front of the sequence
- [ ] compute an overall alignment score (probably simply the highest number from score matrix)
- [ ] decide how to best implement for later Django
	- [ ] e.g. objects or command line file calling with functions (currently latter)
	- [ ] take in file of many sequences formatted correctly and uploaded to front end or take in two sequences via command line from long response front end form box (currently former)
		- we may also want both to give users options for large and slow or small and quick alignments
	- [ ] these can be easily changed later but will take some time to ensure error-free algorithms are preserved

## Double Checking
Checklist for double checking

## Bugs
Going to do more bug-checking and testing. Also going to build a framework of functions to test the outputs of stuff that I write.
